    "# Which Files In My Workspace Are Persistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first start your workspace, there should be at least three folders already in the file browser: che, maap-users, and <username>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* che contains config files for your ADE.  You don’t need to worry about it. \n",
    "* maap-users is an s3-backed folder shared among all members of the maap-users organization (every registered MAAP user).  If you are in other MAAP organizations, each organization will have its own shared s3-backed folder.  \n",
    "* Finally, <username> is also s3-backed, but only shown to you.  However, when you share your workspace with another user, both users’ personal folders will be mounted and accessible from the shared workspace.\n",
    "Anything placed within a s3-backed folder will be added to s3 and be persistent.  Anything outside those folders will be ephemeral.Please clone your git repositories (e.g. dps_plot) outside the s3-backed folders, as they should already be version controlled elsewhere."
