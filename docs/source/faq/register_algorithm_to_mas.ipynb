    "# How Do I Register An Algorithm To MAS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, make sure your algorithm can run in your environment and all changes have been committed/pushed to GitLab or your external repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready, in the file browser, right click the file which you wish to register as an algorithm and select *Register as MAS Algorithm*. \n",
    "\n",
    "![register_as_mas_algorithm](../_static/register_as_mas_algorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your changes have not been committed, there will be a popup asking you to commit your changes first. The fields will be summarized for you in a form. \n",
    "\n",
    "![register_algorithm](../_static/register_algorithm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are saved in the automatically generated file *algorithm_config.yaml*, in the same directory as the script to be run. Don’t register the algorithm if any fields are missing or incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click cancel and open the file *algorithm_config.yaml* to edit those fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "![algorithm_config](../_static/algorithm_config.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When everything is correct, save your config changes and right-click the file again to register your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "There will only be one *algorithm_config.yaml* file for any directory. If you have multiple scripts to be registered as algorithms, consider separating them into different folders.The outputs should be written to a folder named outputs."
