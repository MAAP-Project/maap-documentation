    "\n",
    "Code is version-controlled using git, which may be GitHub or MAAP GitLab. Jupyter also provides a GUI widget to help with code push/pull as a sidebar tool. Git is intended to help with collaborative code development; Algorithms run at scale in the MAAP must first be [pushed to the MAAP GitLab](#the-maap-gitlab-code-repository) in order to facilitate registration.\n",

    "The MAAP platform offers a variety of functionality. Access to the functionality is gained via the underlying [MAAP API](https://api.maap-project.org/api/). In a Python notebook, you will typically use this API via a helper library called `maap.py`, which will make using MAAP platform features easy, using Python syntax. For example, registering algorithms, running batches of jobs, monitoring jobs, or accessing data.\n",
