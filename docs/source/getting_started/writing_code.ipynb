    "# Writing and Managing Code with MAAP\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and editing code in the MAAP is done in a Jupyter workspace. Jupyter is a web-based development environment that allows for interactive coding in \"notebooks\". MAAP supports notebooks written in Python and R with pre-configured workspace-types (\"Stacks\"). Jupyter has caught on with the data-science community because it is possible to write and share notebooks with code, commentary, and data-visualizations mixed together in one place.\n",
