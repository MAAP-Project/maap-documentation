    "# Writing and Managing Code with MAAP\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and editing code in the MAAP is done in a Jupyter workspace. Jupyter is a web-based development environment that allows for interactive coding in \"notebooks\". MAAP supports notebooks written in Python and R with pre-configured workspace-types (\"Stacks\"). Jupyter has caught on with the data-science community because it is possible to write and share notebooks with code, commentary, and data-visualizations mixed together in one place.\n",

    "To make sure that an Algorithm is functioning as expected, we can run it in the Jupyter terminal in a way to mimic how the scaled DPS (Data Processing System) will run it.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the DPS runs an algorithm, it will first copy input files into a folder called `input/`. It will write outputs into a folder called `output/`. In order to mimic this, let's copy a test file from the `dps-unit-test` repo into a temporary test-run folder `/tmp/my_test_run/input`. (When we get to the [actual run in the DPS](running_at_scale.ipynb#Run-the-Algorithm-as-a-Job-and-Monitor-it), you will specify an input file URL and that file will be downloaded into the `input/` folder of the cloud-worker before execution of the algorithm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cloned the demo repository to `~/algorithms`, then the files should be somewhere like `~/algorithms/dps-unit-test`. For the sake of the example below, we will assume this is where the demo repo has been cloned.\n",
