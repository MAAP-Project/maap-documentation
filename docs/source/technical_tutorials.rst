Technical Tutorials
=======================================

This section of the documentation includes hands-on tutorials with example algorithms and data-sets. It is focused on learning how to use the MAAP platform, and not science-oriented.

**Note:** Tutorials are written in Python *except* for those under :ref:`Working with R <working_with_r_section>`. For current documents written in R, please see :ref:`Working with R <working_with_r_section>`.
