    "The Earthdata Search Client (EDSC) allows users to search, preview, download, and access EOSDIS Earth observation data. The MAAP has its own separate instance of NASA's EDSC which is located at [search.maap-project.org](http://search.maap-project.org). This MAAP ESDC provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the MAAP's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) in order to make the process of discovering data easy for MAAP users. \n",

    "We can use the searchbar to search for a term (example: *GEDI*) to narrow the resulting collections. The search can be further refined by picking a temporal range from the calendar using the **Temporal** ![Temporal](../_static/temporal.png) button and setting spatial boundaries using the **Spatial** ![Spatial](../_static/spatial.png) button. Additionally, using the **Advanced search** ![Advanced search](../_static/advanced_search.png) lets you search by the HUC ID or region (more information about hydrological units may be found [here](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html)). You can use the **Clear Filters** ![Clear Filters](../_static/clear_filters.png) button to undo any filters that have been set. The sidebar to the left allows you to further refine your search by selecting one of the available facets. These include *Features*, *Keywords*, *Platforms*, *Instruments*, *Organizations*, *Projects*, and *Processing levels*.\n",

We can search spatially using **Search by spatial polygon** ![Search by spatial polygon](../_static/search_by_spatial_polygon.png), **Search by spatial rectangle** ![Search by spatial rectangle](../_static/search_by_spatial_rectangle.png), and **Search by spatial coordinate** ![Search by spatial coordinate](../_static/search_by_spatial_coordinate.png). Layers may be edited using the **Edit layers** ![Edit layers](../_static/edit_layers.png) button and deleted using the **Delete layers** ![Delete layers](../_static/delete_layers.png) buttons. There are also options for **North Polar Stereographic** ![North Polar Stereographic](../_static/north_polar_stereographic.png), **Geographic (Equirectangular)** ![Geographic (Equirectangular)](../_static/geographic.png), and **South Polar Stereographic** ![South Polar Stereographic](../_static/south_polar_stereographic.png) projections. There are options to **Zoom in** ![Zoom in](../_static/zoom_in.png), **Zoom home** ![Zoom home](../_static/zoom_home.png), and **Zoom out** ![Zoom out](../_static/zoom_out.png).

The **View collection details** ![View collection details](../_static/view_collection_details.png) button may be used to view related URLs and additional information about the selected collection. Also, collections may be added to a project using the **Add collection to the current project** ![Add collection to the current project](../_static/add_collection_to_the_current_project.png) button. Clicking anywhere else on a result allows you to see the granules within the collection available for download."
