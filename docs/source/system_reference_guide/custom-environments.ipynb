    "## Extending environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may need libraries for their specific analysis purposes that are not present in the environments of the different workspace options offered. In this case, ideally, the steps should be the following : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user explores her/his environment need by extending the environment of an existing workspace or creating her/his custom environment in an existing workspace (see next sections).\n",
    "2. Once that is done, the user submits a ticket/coordinates with the platform team to create a new workspace option with the requested, finalized environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above approach is ideal because modifications to the pre-defined workspace environment do not survive a workspace restart (see next sections), and because sharing new experimented environments is valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections explain how to extend environments or create custom environments, and for this, introduces information regarding which environment management solution we are using. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `mamba` (a fast `conda` drop-in replacement) as a package manager to install, update or remove packages (libraries). `mamba` works with 'environments' that are directories in your local file system containing a set of packages. When you work 'in a given environment', it means that your programs will look for dependencies in that environment's `mamba` directory. All workspaces launch with an environment called `base`, which is a `mamba` environment that has all the pre-installed libraries. If you open a terminal launcher after creating a `Basic Stable` workspace : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Base conda environment location](../_static/base_conda_environment_location.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that a `base` `mamba` environment is activated, and its libraries are located in `/opt/conda`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending the `base` environment in a given workspace session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note : any modification to the `base` environment does not survive a workspace restart. In other words, modifications to `/opt/conda` disappear after a workspace restart**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extending an existing `mamba` environment means adding packages on top of what it contains, which works provided there are no dependency conflicts. You can install libraries using the `mamba install` command to install additional packages in your current environment (run `mamba --help` to learn more about how to use `mamba` commands). For example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba install xarray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is recommended to use configuration files for reproducibility and shareability. With this approach, assuming your configuration file is named `config.yml`, the command to use is : \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env update -f config.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on configuration files, see the [Custom environments section](#Custom-environments) and for an example of this command, refer to the [subsection about updating an environment with a configuration file](#Updating-an-existing-environment-with-a-configuration-file).\n"

    "You can use the `mamba` CLI to create a new, custom environment. The parameters (the list of libraries, the location where to search for them, etc...) can be passed either from a configuration YAML file or directly on the console. We recommend using the first option (a YAML file is easier to share and modify). \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env create -f env-example.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this stores this environment files in `/opt/conda`, which is a directory that is recreated when the workspace restarts, and so custom environments are lost. Therefore, you want to specify a storage location in your user directory with the `--prefix` parameter\n",

    "```\n",
    "mamba env create -f env-example.yml --prefix /projects/env\n",

    "You can *update* an existing environment with a configuration file as well. For example, let's assume you have a `mamba` environment with a set of packages already installed in it (for example the `base` environment), but it doesn't have `xarray` and `geopandas`. Using the linked example config : \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env update -f env-extend.yml\n",

    "\n",
    "Some python packages might not be availabe in the channel you are using, or in any `mamba` channel. If that package however is in `PyPI` (the official python package repository), one can use `pip` within a `mamba` environment to download packages. The recommended way is to specify this in the configuration file. In the linked example, we add `stackstac` as a dependency to install from `PyPI` because it is not available in the `conda-forge` channel. \n",

    "MAAP users typically use the python `maap-py`. It's pre-installed in all workspaces, in the `base` mamba environment, but any custom environment should specify it, otherwise it is not going to be accessible from that environment. However, `maap-py` is not packaged in a public package repository, like `PyPI` or `conda-forge`. It is possible to install it directly from its github repository with `pip` though. See the configuration example linked. You can note that in the example, `maap-py` is 'versioned' using a commit hash (at the end of the github URL). "
