    "## Extending environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may need libraries for their specific analysis purposes that are not present in the environments of the different workspace options offered. In this case, ideally, the steps should be the following : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user explores her/his environment need by extending the environment of an existing workspace or creating her/his custom environment in an existing workspace (see next sections).\n",
    "2. Once that is done, the user submits a ticket/coordinates with the platform team to create a new workspace option with the requested, finalized environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above approach is ideal because modifications to the pre-defined workspace environment do not survive a workspace restart (see next sections), and because sharing new experimented environments is valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections explain how to extend environments or create custom environments, and for this, introduces information regarding which environment management solution we are using. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `conda` with the libmamba solver as a package manager to install, update or remove packages (libraries). `conda` works with 'environments' that are directories in your local file system containing a set of packages. When you work 'in a given environment', it means that your programs will look for dependencies in that environment's `conda` directory. All workspaces launch with an initial environment that has all the pre-installed libraries for that workspace. The actual name of that environment depends on the workspace chosen by the user. For example, for the pangeo workspace, the base environment is called `pangeo`. If you open a terminal launcher after creating a `Pangeo` workspace : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pangeo conda environment location](../_static/pangeo_environment_location.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that a `pangeo` `conda` environment is activated, and its libraries are located in `/opt/conda/envs/pangeo`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending the initial environment in a given workspace session\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "Note 1: hereafter in the documentation the conda environment activated by default for a given workspace is named `base` although it may actually be different (e.g. for pangeo workspaces the name is `pangeo`)\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "Note 2: any modification to the `base` environment does not survive a workspace restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending an existing `conda` environment means adding packages on top of what it contains, which works provided there are no dependency conflicts. You can install libraries using the `conda install` command to install additional packages in your current environment (run `conda --help` to learn more about how to use `conda` commands). All `conda` install commands should use `-c conda-forge` otherwise it's unlikely to work, since many/most of the packages installed already are from conda-forge. For example :\n",

    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge xarray\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install --solver=classic -c conda-forge xarray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is recommended to use configuration files for reproducibility and shareability. With this approach, assuming your configuration file is named `config.yml`, the command to use is : \n",

It's pre-installed in all workspaces, in the `base` conda environment, but any custom environment should specify it, otherwise it is not going to be accessible from that environment. However, `maap-py` is not packaged in a public package repository, like `PyPI` or `conda-forge`. It is possible to install it directly from its github repository with `pip` though. See the configuration example linked. You can note that in the example, `maap-py` is 'versioned' using a commit hash (at the end of the github URL). "
