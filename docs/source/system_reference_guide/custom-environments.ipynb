    "## Extending environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may need libraries for their specific analysis purposes that are not present in the environments of the different workspace options offered. In this case, ideally, the steps should be the following : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user explores her/his environment need by extending the environment of an existing workspace or creating her/his custom environment in an existing workspace (see next sections).\n",
    "2. Once that is done, the user submits a ticket/coordinates with the platform team to create a new workspace option with the requested, finalized environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above approach is ideal because modifications to the pre-defined workspace environment do not survive a workspace restart (see next sections), and because sharing new experimented environments is valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections explain how to extend environments or create custom environments, and for this, introduces information regarding which environment management solution we are using. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `conda` with the libmamba solver as a package manager to install, update or remove packages (libraries). `conda` works with 'environments' that are directories in your local file system containing a set of packages. When you work 'in a given environment', it means that your programs will look for dependencies in that environment's `conda` directory. All workspaces launch with a default environment that has all the pre-installed libraries for that workspace. The actual name of the default environment depends on the workspace chosen by the user. For example, for the pangeo workspace, the default environment is called `pangeo`. If you open a terminal launcher after creating a `Pangeo` workspace : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pangeo conda environment location](../_static/pangeo_environment_location.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that a `pangeo` `conda` environment is activated by default, and its libraries are located in `/opt/conda/envs/pangeo`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending the default environment in a given workspace session\n",
    "\n",
    "*Throughout this document, \"the default workspace environment\" refers to the conda environment activated by default in a given workspace environment. The name of that conda environment differs across workspaces. Any modification to the default workspace environment, or to the `base` environment, does not survive a workspace restart.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending an existing `conda` environment means adding packages on top of what it contains, which works provided there are no dependency conflicts. You can install libraries using the `conda install` command to install additional packages in your current environment (run `conda --help` to learn more about how to use `conda` commands). All `conda` install commands should use `-c conda-forge` otherwise it's unlikely to work, since many/most of the packages installed already are from conda-forge. For example :\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install --solver=classic -c conda-forge xarray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is recommended to use configuration files for reproducibility and shareability. With this approach, assuming your configuration file is named `config.yml`, the command to use is : \n",

The parameters (the list of libraries, the location where to search for them, etc...) can be passed either from a configuration YAML file or directly on the console.

In the linked example, we add `stackstac` as a dependency to install from `PyPI` because it is not available in the `conda-forge` channel. \n",

However, `maap-py` is not packaged in a public package repository, like `PyPI` or `conda-forge`. It is possible to install it directly from its Github repository with `pip` though. See the configuration example linked. You can note that in the example, `maap-py` is 'versioned' using one of the `maap-py` git version tags.
