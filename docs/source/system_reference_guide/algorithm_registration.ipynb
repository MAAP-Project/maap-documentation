    "The Container URL is a dropdown where the default is a standard minimal container called `maap_base` image such as `mas.maap-project.org/root/maap-workspaces/custom_images/maap_base:v4.2.0`. The other option is the Container of your current workspace (i.e. R, pangeo, etc.). These containers will have numerous conda packages installed which may or may not be useful for you. Just a note if you want the default conda packages for your current workspace container, if you successfully ran the Algorithm in a Terminal without adding additional packages, then you should be able to successfully use your current workspace container as the **Container URL** for your algorithm. \n",
    "We recommend using `maap_base` as it makes algorithm registration faster, although using it means you need to manage your own conda packages. More information how to make a custom conda environment [here](custom-environments.html#Custom-environments).\n",
    "\n",

    "https://repo.maap-project.org/root/maap-workspaces/container_registry (choose `Packages and Registries > Container registry` if you go to the main maap-workspaces area). Find your base Stack and dig in until you can copy the link of the specific version of Stack that you need, as demonstrated in these screenshots:\n",

    "![Container copy link](../getting_started/_static/registry-3-copy-link.png)\n",
    "This custom Container URL can be used if you register your algorithm from a yaml file instead of our algorithms UI. You can generate a sample yaml file by registering the algorithm with all your other arguments, then in the resulting generated yaml file in the `algorithm-configs` folder, you can manually change the Container URL. \n",

    "4. Once all information is filled out, click the __Register Algorithm__ button at the bottom of the form. After a few seconds, a modal will appear with the link to the registration job that was just submitted. Users can navigate to this link to access the registration logs and confirm their algorithm was registered successfully.\n",
