    "- \"... made available in a publicly accessible repository that is widely recognized by the community.\"\n",

It is best to familiarize yourself with policy documentation (the [SPD-41a](https://smd-cms.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smd-information-policy-spd-41a.pdf)) and reach out to the appropriate contact for advice if an exception could apply to your software. There are also some additional policies that can apply if NASA-funded. This documentation is to help provide some guidance and encourage MAAP users to enagage and comply with open-source science and policies."
