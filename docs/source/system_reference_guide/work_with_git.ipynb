Create a classic personal access token by following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) in Developer settings. Remember to save your personal access token for later use. \n",
