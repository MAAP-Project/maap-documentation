MAAP users are advised to use two catalogs:

1. Use NASA's Operational CMR to discover NASA-produced and curated data: https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov
2. Use MAAP STAC for data not found in NASA CMR, and data produced by MAAP users: https://stac.maap-project.org

The https://cmr.maap-project.org catalog will be deprecated by **May 1, 2023**. Users should request collections they need from this catalog to be made discoverable in the MAAP STAC or NASA's Operational CMR if they're not already there.

More information on each catalog and migrating from MAAP's CMR here: `MAAP's Dual Catalog </search/catalog.html>`_.
