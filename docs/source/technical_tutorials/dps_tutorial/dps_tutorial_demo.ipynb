    "The MAAP DPS (Data Processing System) lets you run an Algorithm at scale, in the cloud. It is different from running a Jupyter notebook in that it is non-interactive. Therefore, when migrating a notebook to the DPS it needs to be altered to take all of the input parameters at once as a command-line program. Even if you start with a command-line script, there are best practices to follow when preparing it for the DPS. Once that is done, the Algorithm can be Registered in a way that allows you to execute analysis jobs using a web-based form, where each field is defined during the Registration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPS will then be able to take a set of inputs and process them at scale. You do not need to worry about scheduling or scaling your jobs. You can also run your DPS Algorithm using the maap.py Python library in a loop to execute a batch of jobs (e.g., 1000 input files and one job per input-file). The DPS will manage the compute resources to handle your request, and you can easily find all of your outputs as each individual job completes."

    "### What happens with input and output in DPS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the jobs on DPS are run on a machine on the cloud, your local workspace directories are not available. It is important to pass any files required as inputs for your algorithm using the `File` parameter type. \n",
    "Any outputs that need to be saved should be placed in a directory called `output`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a parameter is registered as a file input, DPS downloads the corresponding value provided by the user as a file and places it in a directory called `input`. \n",
    "It is important to note that if the value provided a parameter marked as file during registration is not a valid url, DPS will report an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Both `input` and `output` directories are relative to your run script. \n",
    " \n",
    "### How does file management happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "File management i.e. files required for input and files stored as outputs on S3 are taken care of by the DPS. To locate the files created as an output from your job, look into the `/projects/my-private-bucket/dps_output` dir on your workspace and navigate to the algorithm type and time of run. \n",

    "You can also construct the output path of your files by looking at the job info on the Jobs UI or by running \n",
