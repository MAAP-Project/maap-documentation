    "# Memory Profiling Python Scripts in the MAAP ADE\n",

    "Description: Memory profiling your Python script is a good practice to understand the resource requirements. This is useful when you have working code and you want to estimate the size of the DPS worker to be used. Additionally, it is helpful to optimize the code for resource requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use [memory-profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) for profiling a sample Python script [demo_memory_profiling.py](./demo_memory_profiling.py). We also see how to log the output to a `.log` file.   \n",

    "### Run This Notebook\n",
    "To access and run this tutorial within MAAP's Algorithm Development Environment (ADE), please refer to the [\"Getting started with the MAAP\"](https://docs.maap-project.org/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html) section of our documentation.\n",

    "You may add the `@profile` decorator to individual functions that you want to profile. This allows you to limit which parts of your program are profiled, thus limiting the volume of profiling output.\n",
