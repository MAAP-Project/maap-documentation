    "We can use the searchbar to search for a term (example: *GEDI*) to narrow the resulting collections. The search can be further refined by picking a temporal range from the calendar using the **Temporal** ![Temporal](../../_static/temporal.png) button and setting spatial boundaries using the **Spatial** ![Spatial](../../_static/spatial.png) button. Additionally, using the **Advanced search** ![Advanced search](../../_static/advanced_search.png) lets you search by the HUC ID or region (more information about hydrological units may be found [here](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html)). You can use the **Clear Search** ![Clear Filters](../../_static/clear_filters.png) button to undo any filters that have been set. The sidebar to the left allows you to further refine your search by selecting one of the available facets. These include *Features*, *Keywords*, *Platforms*, *Instruments*, *Organizations*, *Projects*, *Processing levels*, *Date Format*, *Tiling System*, *Horizontal Data Resolution*, and *Latency*.\n",

    "We can also use the tools with the background map to refine our search. We can search spatially using **Search by spatial polygon** ![Search by spatial polygon](../../_static/search_by_spatial_polygon.png), **Search by spatial rectangle** ![Search by spatial rectangle](../../_static/search_by_spatial_rectangle.png), **Search by spatial circle** ![Search by spatial circle](../../_static/search_by_spatial_circle.png), and **Search by spatial coordinate** ![Search by spatial coordinate](../../_static/search_by_spatial_coordinate.png). Layers may be edited using the **Edit layers** ![Edit layers](../../_static/edit_layers.png) button and deleted using the **Delete layers** ![Delete layers](../../_static/delete_layers.png) buttons. There are also options for **North Polar Stereographic** ![North Polar Stereographic](../../_static/north_polar_stereographic.png), **Geographic (Equirectangular)** ![Geographic (Equirectangular)](../../_static/geographic.png), and **South Polar Stereographic** ![South Polar Stereographic](../../_static/south_polar_stereographic.png) projections. There are options to **Zoom in** ![Zoom in](../../_static/zoom_in.png), **Zoom home** ![Zoom home](../../_static/zoom_home.png), and **Zoom out** ![Zoom out](../../_static/zoom_out.png). Finally, we can change the basemap by selecting the **Map layers** ![Map layers](../../_static/map_layers.png) button. \n",

    "The results of the search are displayed in the *Matching Collections* section. Collection names and summaries for each result are shown here. The **View collection details** ![View collection details](../../_static/view_collection_details.png) button may be used to view related URLs and additional information about the selected collection. Also, collections may be added to a project using the **Add collection to the current project** ![Add collection to the current project](../../_static/add_collection_to_the_current_project.png) button. Clicking anywhere else on a result allows you to see the granules within the collection available for download."
