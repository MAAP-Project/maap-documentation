    "We can use the searchbar to search for a term (example: *GEDI*) to narrow the resulting collections. The search can be further refined by picking a temporal range from the calendar using the **Temporal** ![Temporal](../../_static/temporal.png) button and setting spatial boundaries using the **Spatial** ![Spatial](../../_static/spatial.png) button. Additionally, using the **Advanced search** ![Advanced search](../../_static/advanced_search.png) lets you search by the HUC ID or region (more information about hydrological units may be found [here](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html)). You can use the **Clear Filters** ![Clear Filters](../../_static/clear_filters.png) button to undo any filters that have been set. The sidebar to the left allows you to further refine your search by selecting one of the available facets. These include *Features*, *Keywords*, *Platforms*, *Instruments*, *Organizations*, *Projects*, and *Processing levels*.\n",

Layers may be edited using the **Edit layers** ![Edit layers](../../_static/edit_layers.png) button and deleted using the **Delete layers** ![Delete layers](../../_static/delete_layers.png) buttons. There are also options for **North Polar Stereographic** ![North Polar Stereographic](../../_static/north_polar_stereographic.png), **Geographic (Equirectangular)** ![Geographic (Equirectangular)](../../_static/geographic.png), and **South Polar Stereographic** ![South Polar Stereographic](../../_static/south_polar_stereographic.png) projections.

Also, collections may be added to a project using the **Add collection to the current project** ![Add collection to the current project](../../_static/add_collection_to_the_current_project.png) button.
