    "\n",
    "MAAP already aims to make biomass-relevant content more discoverable and easily accessible, and has software and tools available to aid in data discoverability. Through the OSSI guidance, additional steps are being implemented to ensure that MAAP continues to promote and enhance open-science such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minting DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for software and Github repositories. DOIs allow your content and software to be uniquely identified and accessed reliably ([doi.org](https://doi.org)).\n",
    "    - MAAP documents and software are available on Github and are also being added to Zenodo repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Licensing our software. Licenses help make our content available to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continually enhancing and adding to our documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAAP users are also encouraged to engage in open-source science. Additional documentation is provided on [DOI minting and licensing](./doi_and_licensing.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In addition, NASA has recently released their  [Open Science 101 curriculum](https://openscience101.org/). The course helps provide a more thorough understanding of open science, enabling participants to actively participate in open science. We recommend users complete the course and begin to align their work with the teachings of the course.**"
