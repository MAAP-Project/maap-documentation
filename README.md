[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/maap-project/badge/?version=latest)](https://maap-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository serves as the technical documentation for interfacing with the Muti-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP)

### Contributing to MAAP Documentation
MAAP documentation is hosted on [maap-project.readthedocs.io](https://maap-project.readthedocs.io), is built using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) and written in [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html). If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can do so by forking the repository, creating a branch for your changes and editing the documentation files in the docs directory of the repo.

You need to install Sphinx and supporting packages locally so that you can make sure that your edits show up correctly before you maske a pull request to the repo. To do this run the following command:

```
$ pip install Sphinx ipykernel nbsphinx sphinxcontrib-napoleon sphinx-rtd-theme pandoc
```
After installing the necessary packages you build the docs using the following command from the docs directory:

```
$ make html
```

Once the docs have been built successfully, there should be a `build/` directory with the HTML pages.
